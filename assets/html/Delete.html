                <h3><b>About Me</b></h3>
                <p>
                    Currently I'm looking for a position that will allow me to improve my skills, learn new ones, and inspire
                    me to grow as a person for the organisation as well as for my own success.

                    During my Mtech, I conducted research on knowledge graph-based enhanced information retrieval
                    and recommender systems. As a part, I created an ontology using Protégé and a knowledge graph
                    using a supercomputer and Python programming and named it KGC19 (Knowledge Graph of Covid-19
                    Scholarly Articles) to improve information retrieval and recommendation systems. KGC19 is my own
                    work, which hopefully will soon contribute to open source and the semantic web. At the time, it
                    was exhausting, but worth every second of the time I invested as I got to learn many things and
                    polish my Python as well as my problem-solving skills too. During my Mtech, I also published a
                    survey paper in the scopus-indexed Springer conference ICOECA 2022 and got the best paper award,
                    and my research paper is ready but yet to be published in a suitable conference or journal.
                    Through this process, I developed an interest in data-related tasks using Python, so I joined
                    the course "2022 Python Data Analysis & Visualization Masterclass" by the instructor named Colt
                    Steele. He has amazing skills and a way of teaching.

                    And in my bachelor's degree, as a BTech final project, I created a real-time gesture-based project
                    for controlling the mouse and hiding desired files using dynamic gestures. It was an amazing
                    experience. Also, I developed an interest in the Python language as well as Web development, so
                    as a side learning, I have completed The Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy by Colt Steele and
                    learned more about Python. With that, I have always been curious to use that knowledge and
                    create projects, so I created my own portfolio and also many small projects which you can see in the project section.

                    Apart from these, I like spending time with my friends and family, and I also love to play
                    cricket.
